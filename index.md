## Welcome to Charlie Creations

The place (pseudo) where I am learning how to integrate with the open world and everything open source. I am hoping to learn to code along the way and most importantly I want to sait my craving to write and let people read my ramblings.

I am starting by learning a bit of **markdown** and of course the oh so powerful and popular _GitHub_ where all `code` lives.

I am learning about [links](www.evdriver.co.uk) and how to bring in an ![image](src).
`` 

I am going to keep this for details: [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### I aim to learn about Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nqwabuko/nqwabuko.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### I keep this for my own sake: Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.
